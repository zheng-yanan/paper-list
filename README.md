## Disentangled Representation Learning

Disentangled representations learning is an unsupervised learning technique that disentangles each feature into narrowly defined variables and encodes them as separated dimensions.
Its goal is to mimic the quick intuition process of a human, using both “high” and “low” dimension reasoning.
This is a collection of milestone papers on disentangled representation learning since 2016.
